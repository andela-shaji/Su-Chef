An app that implements firebase authentication. With the latest news from Google I/O comes the new and upgraded Firebase. 

Firebase provides a full set of authentication options out-of-the-box. Firebase automatically stores your users’ credentials securely (using bcrypt) and redundantly (with replication and daily off-site backups). This separates sensitive user credentials from your application data, and lets you focus on the user interface and experience for your app.

###Features of Firebase
Firebase comes with bunch features essential for every android app starting from authentication to hosting the app.
Below are the advantages using Firebase in general:
* Super easy and quick to implement.
* No server side configuration needed. No PHP Scripts and No Database Designs.
* Realtime update without using GCM.
* Autoscaling built-in
* Can start for free (only need to start paying once we hit 50 connections)
* Robust APIs for Javascript (including several frameworks like Angular), iOS, and Android
* Built-in support for authentication services like Facebook, Google, and Twitter
* Declarative Security Rules model allows us to enforce read/write privileges and data validation throughout the tree

Some of the disadvantages of Firebase can be sum up in the following:
* Need to build indexes manually
* May need to build “event log” manually as well (in separate sub-tree?)
* Implementation of REST API could be difficult on embedded platforms
* Data validation rules do not support complex objects directly
